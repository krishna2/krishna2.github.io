# Vishnu Sahasaranamam

The Vishnu Sahasaranamam (VS) is a list of 1000 (Sahasra) names (namam) of Lord Vishnu. 
The following write up is to explain the story and significance of it a little bit so one 
can understand it holistically as to how VS fits with Bhagavad Gita (BG) and the Vedas (the main scriptures of Hinduism).

Mahabharata (MB) is a great epic that details the story of the clan of Kurus in ancient India (Bharat). VS occurs in the Anushasana Parva which is the 13th of the 18 books that forms the MB. In the previous book (Shanti parva), the longest book, King Yudhisthira seeks advice from all the sages and from Bhishma.

King Yuddhistra asks six questions (Shat (six) Prashni (questions)) to his grandfather Bhishma to which he answers succinctly at first with superlative terms and then goes on to elaborate that the answer to all the six questions involve the same person (Lord Vishnu) who is known by 1000 names which is VS.

Then comes a big reveal and closes with words of praise from various sages and gods including the grand promise from Lord Vishnu himself and what fruits / knowledge one gets from following all these prescriptions.

## VS: Yudhistira’s Questions

It will probably be helpful to keep in the mind the [background of Mahabharata](https://krishna2.com/bg/author) and the [greatness of Vyasa](https://krishna2.com/vyasa).

Back to VS, there is an important shloka right at the beginning that goes “Vaishampayana Uvacha'' which means Sage Vaishampayana said after hearing all the topics that are to be discussed, King Yudhisthira asked Bhishma (Shaanthanavam, Son of Shantanu) once again these questions.

| Sanskrit | Transliteration | Translation |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| श्रीवैशम्पायन उवाच | shrIvaishampAyana uvAcha | Sri Vaisampayana said |
| श्रुत्वा धर्मानशेषेण पावनानि च सर्वशः । | shrutvA dharmAnasheSheNa pAvanAni cha sarvashaH | Having heard the Dharma in its entirety and the holy ones in all respects |
| युधिष्ठिरः शान्तनवं पुनरेवाभ्यभाषत ॥ ७॥ | yudhiShThiraH shAntanavaM punarevAbhyabhAShata (7) | Yudhisthira again addressed Bhisma (Shantanu's Putraha (Son) Shaanthanu - hence Shaantanavam : to Shaantanu). |

In fact, before VS, King Yudhishtira asks about Neethi - how a good king should rule and that answer to which extends to 5000+ shlokas as answered by Bhishma and other sages), 

Then VS goes "Yudhishthira Uvacha".

| Sanskrit | Transliteration | Translation |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| युधिष्ठिर उवाच | yudhiShThira uvAcha | Yudhisthira asked |
| किमेकं दैवतं लोके किं वाप्येकं परायणम् । | kimekaM daivataM loke kiM vApyekaM parAyaNam | Questions 1 and 2 |
| स्तुवन्तः कं कमर्चन्तः प्राप्नुयुर्मानवाः शुभम् ॥ ८॥ | stuvantaH kaM kamarchantaH prApnuyurmAnavAH shubham (8) | Questions 3 and 4 |
| को धर्मः सर्वधर्माणां भवतः परमो मतः । | ko dharmaH sarvadharmANAM bhavataH paramo mataH | Question 5 |
| किं जपन्मुच्यते जन्तुर्जन्मसंसारबन्धनात् ॥ ९॥ | kiM japanmuchyate janturjanmasa.nsArabandhanAt (9) | Question 6 |

That's it! A short two verses, 4 lines, 64 syllables is all it takes for Yudhisthira to ask all the questions that matter.

So there are Yudhisthira's **SIX questions** (Shat prashni). 

Bhishma is only too glad to answer these questions. But after giving a brief couple of lines for each question, 

And after that, he concludes with a grand reveal. But you will have to wait for a few more paras. :)

Normally at this point, there is a digression from the main namas and that's where VS goes "Dhyanam". 

Since this work is meant to be a Upasana (used in rituals as well as in meditation). VS is conducive to both Saguna Upasana and Nirguna Upasana. It is the Eka Rupa Eswara as well as the Vishwa Rupa Eswara. It is Karma Yoga (when we recite and chant it) but at the same time contains teachings of Gnana Yoga.

Before we go to the six questions, a quick Sanskrit glossary.

`Kim`, `Ko`, `Kam` all the three words means `Who`. So you can say VS is `The Who`.

Now for the six questions. These are generally chanted at Express speeds (Rajdhani express, Bullet Train, MagLev what have you) and if you snooze you lose the import. If you space out for a little bit, all these are gone and you are essentially hearing the entire VS which are answers to these six questions.

So next time when we chant or listen to the chant, it might help to take a pause and reflect that questions were asked and what they are.

## VS: Bhishma's Answers



Then VS goes bhIShma uvAcha - Bhishma said.

(Question 1.)  Kim ekam daivatam loke

Who ("kim") is the greatest ("ekam") Lord ("daivatam") in the world ("loke")?

(Answer 1.)

Answers 5&6.

anAdinidhanaM viShNuM sarvalokamaheshvaram |
lokAdhyakShaM stuvannityaM sarvaduHkhAtigo bhavet || 

Both questions are answered here: - the greatest Dharma is the one Vishnu, who has neither a beginning (Aadi) nor an end (Nidhanam), the supreme Lord ("maheshwaram") of the world. All creatures can go beyond the bonds of samsara, “and he goes beyond all sorrows” who daily ("nityam") chants ("stuvan") the sahasranamams and within glorifies “the knower of the world” (Lokaadhyaksha).


he goes on to elaborate that such a big person / god he just described has 1000 majestic names. And here are the 1000. 

यानि नामानि गौणानि विख्यातानि महात्मनः ।
ऋषिभिः परिगीतानि तानि वक्ष्यामि भूतये ॥ १९॥

yAni nAmAni gauNAni vikhyAtAni mahAtmanaH |
R^iShibhiH parigItAni tAni vakShyAmi bhUtaye || 


Those famous names of the Great Soul which bring out His manifold qualities celebrated by rishis (seers) I shall declare for the good (of all).


## VS: Dhyanam and the Sahasranamams

Back to VS. In the section that follows “Dhyanam”, and starts with “Ksheero danvat” … it is a description of Lord Vishnua as a person in human form. But it is also a superior description of depicting the entire Universe.

After this, begins the list of 1000 names starting with “Viswam Vishnur VashatkarO Bhuta Bhavya Bhavatprabhuhu”.

Each of these names have deeper significant meanings than what we gleam from a quick reading of the Sanskrit definition.

Viswam : One who is the Universe
Vishnuhu: One who is in everything
… so on. It starts with “all in one” and “one in all”.

There are many different counts that go to say that there are 1031 names or there are something between 1000 and 1031, that some are repeated twice, some thrice and one nama repeated four times. Yet another goes to clarify that it is only 1000 names but the repeats are an adjective to further explain a name.

The list ends at “Sarva Praharanayudhaha”.


## VS: Avatara Reveal

Then comes  a prayer that we generally chant 3 times.

वनमाली गदी शार्ङ्गी शङ्खी चक्री च नन्दकी ।
श्रीमान् नारायणो विष्णुर्वासुदेवोऽभिरक्षतु ॥ १०८॥
श्री वासुदेवोऽभिरक्षतु ॐ नम इति ।


(Chant this shloka 3 times)

Protect us Oh Lord Narayana
Who wears the forest garland,
Who has the mace, conch, sword and the wheel.
And who is called Vishnu and Vasudeva.

While all along every one is thinking of the divine Lord Vishnu who is this greatest lord being described and who has the 1000 names, here is a prayer that then connects that the Lord Vishnu is also Vasudeva, Lord Krishna, who has been standing right there all along, with Yudhistira, Bhishma and others.

Lord Krishna is the cousin of Yudhistira, Arjuna, and the Pandavas. In addition he is actually a brother-in-law to Arjuna. But for a few, none recognizes him as the Avatara. At best, Kunti (mother of Pandavas), Draupadi (wife of the Pandavas) and Bhishma know him as such. Arjuna too realizes this only in Chapter 4 (Jnana Karma Sanyasa Yoga, the first section called as Avatara Rahasyam). He does get 4 other clues prior to this in BG itself but he misses them all. That’s for another post.

While everyone wants to hear from Bhisma, Bhisma wants to hear from the Lord. Which is why after all these conversations are over, he bids everyone goodbye and he just wants the darshan of Lord Krishna alone when he departs his body.

VS finally concludes with a big list of “phala shruti” - the fruits of reading such a work. The lord’s teaching itself has clearly all along been preaching us to not ask for material and unimportant things. It is after all okay to start as such but there are enough indicators in the scriptures for us to move beyond the initial stages of learning, prayers, meditation, and practices. To miss this is to miss the forest for the trees. 


## Who is it for

The beauty of this work is that it has something for everyone from literary to philosophical to religious to spiritual inclinations.

One can read this as a fictional or mythological story and you get to hear about the greatest virtues of a SuperHero. Where else can you hear 1000 names of one person? That too praised by someone else? If everything is a story, there are still morals and examples that we can be inspired by and techniques that may help us. Just like “caveat emptor” for purchases, take the best, leave the rest.

One can read this from a literary standpoint and enjoy the style of the poetry and prose, Anushtup meter (two lines, four parts, each with exactly 8 syllables with preconditions for the 5th, 6th and 7th syllable whether it can short or long), the rhyming names and terms, the multiple levels of meanings, and most importantly how this connects with the rest of the Mahabharatha, the Bhagavad Gita and various works in the Vedas and in particular, the Upanishads.

One can be an atheist or theist following different gods, in which case, you might just read this for the curiosity of why this work is famous, why this is chanted by millions even though barring a small population the rest likely don’t know the meaning or the history. Learn what is fascinating about this big ancient culture that has converged on these epics and gods.

If one starts with a hinduism based theistic philosophy, then I am preaching to the choir.

One can be an ardent Vishishta Advaitin (following the interpretations of Ramanujacharya) or a Dwaitin (following the interpretations of Madhvacharya) in which case there is no doubt at all - VS is practically the epitome of the scriptures. It is the alpha and omega of the teachings or to bring back the analogy back home, it is the beginning A, the middle U and the ending M ... forming AUM.

One can be an Advaita Vedantin (following the interpretations of Shankaracharya) and still the VS plays the most important role of how one can follow the teachings of Bhagavad Gita, no less.

## What if it is not for me

A short digression to answer a few questions that may pop up.

1. What if this is all cock and bull story? I don’t believe a single word of this.
   Then read it if it all interests you for the literary / entertainment benefit.
2. How can one person do all this?
   Hence he is called an Avatara too - GODly GODlike powers.

3. What if there are contradictions? Hey look, I found a few from just reading 5 pages. 
   - If it is with the history part, yeah, by all means go down that rabbit hole, or more likely wormhole .. and find the truth.
   - If it is with the works / teaching part, then there are few options:
   - Learn it from someone else who could claim that they have understood it without contradictions.
   - Be patient and read more.
   - Take away only the good parts that you can apply to your life.

The last point deserves a call out. If not anything else, if there are morals, models, (either a way of thinking and understanding or as a role model of a superhero or a sage or person or thing) principles, techniques, ideas that you can use in your day to day life to be happy, to be at peace, to understand, then the works have done their purpose. Take the best, leave the rest.

As long as the application of the teaching is to also live a moral, ethical, peaceful life following the golden rule “Do unto others what you want them to do unto you”, then it’s all good.

## It gets deeper

If we are thinking, "Ah, so that's what VS is", please hold your `payasam`, Vyasa is just getting warmed up. There are many many levels more and I will try my best to explain what I know and understand it to be.

We will have to likely traverse through

1. One ultimate goal of the Vedanta teaching
2. Two Yogas leading to the same goal
3. Three Gunas, Three states, Three Shareeras
4. Four Vedas and Four fold qualification (4Ds) and Anubandha Chathustayam
5. Five Karmendriyas and Five Jnanendriyas
6. Six qualifications / Samaadhi Shat Samppati 
7. Seven Topics that a philosophy should cover
8. Eight-fold AShtanga Yoga Way
9. Ninth chapter of Gita / The greatest knowledge greatest secret Raja Vidya Raja Guhya Yoga
10. Tenth chapter of Gita / Vibhuti Yoga / The Lord's Greatness
11. Eleventh chapter of Gita / Vishawarupa Darshana Yoga / What is the divine vision?
12. Twelfth chapter of Gita / Bhakti Yoga / What is Bhakti?

... okay you get the drift.

Great Sages and Swamis have taught and written lots of teaching on all the above. My task it to provide one with enough of a basic map of the land, maybe an inspiring motivation and enthusiasm to seek those teachings and let any of my material to act like the rocket booster fuel. Drop me off as soon as possible and as soon as the purpose is done.

Om Shanti Shanti Shantihi!
