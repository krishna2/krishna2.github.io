# Happy 2025

Here are a few of my favorite reads from 2024.

If I were to just pick one favorite, it is not even a contest. Heck, challenge me to pick one favorite in a decade, it would still be this. Charlie Munger!

Charlie Munger: Poor Charlieâ€™s Almanack
I even wrote about this: [https://krishna2.com/munger](https://krishna2.com/munger)

Just like countless others, I too grew up bewildered by Jackie Chan's movies and his stunts. And I liked his autobiography.

Jackie Chan: Never Grow Up

I read "The Poppy War" - even though I liked it, I didn't want to go down a full-fledged series. I read "Yellowface" and loved it so much. I have "Babel" on my shelf - but (irrationally) I am not reading it thinking that it would be over if I read it. :)

R. F. Kuang: Yellowface 

I can't wait for what R.F. Kuang's going to come up with next.

This is an old classic -- my son recommended this to me. I liked it.

Goethe: The Sorrows of Young Werther

What an amazing biography. Very very inspiring.

Robin Marantz Henig: Monk in the Garden: Life of Gregor Mendel

I had gotten her "Ember in the Ashes" in 2016 or so but never got to it - but this story snipper caught my attention. What a lovely book. It is set in a Motel in a Sierra Nevada town in California. Loved the book. Promptly went back to read "Ember in the ashes". This book (all my rage) won the National Book Award for Young Readers. 
  
Sabhaa Tahir: All my Rage

Everyone's bound to get on this train sooner or later (I think this is being made into a movie) -- 440,000+ reviews on amazon. I got curious and got this book. Liked it.

Freida McFadden: The Housemaid

I am keeping the recommendations to a general audience and hence skipping my Vedanta books (which I thoroughly relish/read and read again many times). Oh, there are a bunch of business books too, a bunch more fiction this year (than my usual ratio) including a few LitRPG and of course, some running related. As always, you can see the full list here:

Here's to a happy prosperous fulfilling 2025!

Happy reading!
