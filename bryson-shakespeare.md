# Shakespeare : The World as a Stage by Bill Bryson

Here are some interesting snippets I learned/liked:

William Shakespeare is one of the most well-known and well-recognized person in the whole world. Yet we know very very little about him. In fact, most of it are educated guesses and theories. All pictures and drawings of Shakespeare are from just 3 sources and of that two were drawn after his death. Only one is believed to be during his lifetime and even that was recovered only about 150+ years after his death (so we really don't know if it was him).

He wrote about a million words (in plays, sonnets, poems..etc) but we have only 14 words that are believed to be written by him (in his own handwriting). Of that, 12 are of his six signatures. And no two signature of his look alike or share the same spelling. And to top it all, the accepted spelling that we now use is not one of those 6.

His father John Shakespeare was a mayor of a big town (Stratford from where Shakespeare is) and he was incharge of allocating budget to invite plays and other drama events in the town. So young Will had a great exposure to theater and drama. Also, there lived another John S. in the same town, who married twice and had three kids - so it took some historians lot of work to separate all the public records to separate the two.

Plague and other diseases and consequently death due to it was so big an issue, the author notes that Shakespeare's greatest achievement must be surviving all the diseases. For two centuries, there were more deaths than births in England. It was only due to the huge incoming immigrants that the population kept growing.

There are lots of notes about Elizabethan times and theaters and customs. All interesting to read. For example, different classes of people wore different materials of cloth. You cannot suddenly dress up one day in satin or silk. You have to be in the proper class first.

Apparently, coffee and tea were not yet introduced to England and tobbaco was just introduced. Wait a minute, the man wrote a million words across so many writing assignments without coffee?? For that feat alone he needs to be immortalized!

Shakespeare used about 29,000 unique words. If you discount lexing (For example, take, taken, taking are all counted as one), then it is about 20,000 unique words. His vocabulary is estimated at 30,000 or so words. The average English speaker today knows about 50,000 words. Of course, Television, fastfood, iPhone, laptop, internet and such words did not exist back then. Hence the explosion in modern day's vocabulary.

But here is the kicker, he coined about 2000 words! A present day author could consider herself lucky if one word she coined were to become popular in use. And once again, since we really don't know much, the correct way to say that would be, it is in Shakespeare's works that we find the first mention of these 2000 or so words. They include : arouse, elbow, hint, luggage, torture, secure, rant, fashionable, laughable, manager, frugal, critic, courtship, buzzer, bedroom, amazement, dawn, lonely, unreal and countless others. Well, including "countless" too.

The author notes that in the Oxford book of idioms and phrases, one-tenth of it is attributed to Shakespeare. A few : a fool's paradise, a foregone conclusion, one fell swoop, be all and end all, foul play, high time, in a pickle, lie low, the game is up, vanish in thin air, up in arms and so on. The next time you hear one too many colorful phrases in a meeting, you know who to blame. And you can retort, "By the way, did you know that phrase was first used in Hamlet? And do you know how Hamlet ends? Tragedy!".

There were lots of rules of how a drama should be. No more than three actors at a time, the whole drame should be set in one time-frame and in one geographical place, and actors cannot immediately reappear in the next scene (must have enough breaks) and get this, no soliloquy. Yup, Shakespeare broke all the rules he wanted to. There would be no "to be or not to be" if the rules were really meant to be.

One more that makes you go "what the ...", the roles of women were played by men too (mostly young men, boys). Women weren't considered to be good actors even for woman roles. Of course, Shakespeare had interesting twist to this. Consider the roles of Rosalind in As You Like It, Julia in Two Gentlemen of Verona, and Viola in Twelfth Night, it was a young man acting as a woman who disguises as a man. FUN.

Also important to note: Shakespeare uses the word 'also' only 36 times in all his works combined.

A huge number of sonnets (120+) are written for a man. We do not know if Shakespeare wrote it for another man, or if he was writing for someone else (who had a man in mind). Was he showing his creative-personality or was he thinking as a woman (although some sonnets do seem to be a man writing to a man). We have only theories. We don't even know in what circumstances and when (exactly) or in what order the sonnets were written. For that matter, we do not know the order of the plays too. We can guess but still get to only about a smaller subset of choices.

No Shakespeare biography is complete without conspiracy theories. There are a huge number of authors, literary folks, who believe that Shakespeare did not write all his works. Some say that someone else at that time did (as many as 50 candidates have been proposed to be the real writer). Some say that it was a consortium of folks who all used the name Shakespeare. Some say it was Marlowe (who was believed to be dead but they thought he was writing all these from Italy or the countryside). The main underlying fact is this: It is hard for them to believe that so much creativite and profound work has come out of a single person. Given the vast array of knowledge used in the plays (law, business, history, navy, military, medicine, royal life, agriculture, about animals ...etc) and the style and the humor, they believed that no one person could know so much and write so well.

Next up, let me point out all the mistakes of Shakespeare and Hamlet. Okay, I am kidding...

But do give the book a read. As for me, the book has rekindled my interest in all things Shakespeare.
