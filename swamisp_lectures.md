# Lectures of Swami Sarvapriyananda

These are lectures given by Swami Sarvapriyananda-ji. These deal with the various topics of Advaita Vedanta.

These are not in any suggested order so feel free to pick the topics that interests you the most. These are also chosen to be stand-alone lectures. But I have grouped them as I think of them as climbing a ladder progressively.

The hope is that these lectures provide a sincere seeker with enough important concepts and as a starting point for more serious study and practice. Many (all) lectures can be listened to multiple times and deeper meanings emerge in every new hearing.

Swami SPji has done many lecture series covering Bhagavad Gita, Mandukya Upanishad, Dris Drishya Viveka, Manisha Panchakam to name just a few.

I wish you well in the journey of life with Advaita Vedanta as the teaching to guide you.

It would look like a hyperbole statement but the above four works has *everything*! Without a doubt, it would require multiple readings, even multiple different commentaries, interpretations and explanations and above all, deep understanding, internalization and practice.


```
ॐ असतो मा सद्गमय ।
तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय ।
मृत्योर्मा अमृतं गमय ।
ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥

Meaning:
OM
Lead us from the Unreal to the Real
Lead us from Darkness unto Light
Lead us from Death to Immortality 
Om Peace Peace Peace.
```

**Om Tat Sat**
