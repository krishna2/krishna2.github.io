# Beethoven and his Fifth Symphony

How much Beethoven can one listen to and write about?

NOT ENOUGH.

I had started this as a comment to a friend and was putting together my various short write ups and youtube links for illustration and found myself giving disclaimers "Okay, over-dose warning" ... but then again ... my wall my feed ... my beethoven .. my music. This is TO BE ENJOYED. FULLY. Hope this post and links are helpful. Those who already know - they'll just relive it. Those who know some, may get motivated to learn more. Those who did not could still now have a few keywords indexed in their minds and the next time you come across this, you will love it (eventually).

Here is a write up and a bunch of links I had once put together to illustrate to some friends the greatness of the Fifth. It would be better as a lec-dem (and probably definitely by someone far far far far far (five fars = infinity, right?) more talented than me musically). But in lieu of that .. this may still be useful. If you watch this in the order, it will help appreciate this more.

Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is one of the greatest masterworks of all time. Not only just a beautiful memorable tune at the outset but it has too many layers of hidden beauty. I realized a lot of that only after listening to music courses taught by experienced professors. [The Great Courses, Audible Courses are a great starting point. Look up Prof. Robert Greenberg.]

The Fifth symphony starts off with the famous "da da da dum" opening. None can beat Beethoven in how much he can eke out from so few notes. It is also called the Fate Symphony - since some perceived it as being written at a time when Fate was knocking Beethoven's door. This would be around 1805 - this is when his deafness was getting worse day by day. So imagine a knocking like "knock knock knock ... KNOCK". He is going deaf. He has a choice to beat himself up and go deeper into depression Or he can stand up, fight back, deal with the cards he is dealt. During World War2 , the Allied Forces used this as their music (ironically in a way since Beethoven was born in Germany but in a way nice to show how Music transcends any one, any place, any time). They used it because V is for Victory and the letter V is denoted in Morse code as "dot dot dot dash" (get it?).

The Symphony is in C Minor - or starts off in C minor. The first movement is a beautiful battle between two themes. First theme in C Minor and the second theme in C Major. You would've to listen to the full 6+ minute movement to hear and comprehend the contrast between the first theme that is denoting emotional conflict and despair fighting with the second theme which denotes hope and courage. I will not give out the answer but please do yourself a favor and listen.

Then there is the second movement and third which follow typical symphony patterns, and we get to the final fourth movement which decides who the winner is - the resolution. Should be no surprises here .. but do hear it to see how the music evolves and how the good overcomes the bad! (C Major wins over C Minor). Oh how so convincingly! We should be eternally glad that Beethoven chose the latter to fight back his difficulties and depression and illness and handicap of deafness with hope and courage and decided to pour all his frustration and anger into his Music.

Finally, here is a visual / graphical representation - just beautiful.
