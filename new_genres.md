# A few new genre of books that I read in recent years

I recently came across a new genre of books - where the entire book is in the form of text messages and group chats.

The book I read: TBH #1: TBH, This Is So Awkward by Lisa Greenwald. It is mainly about three middle-school girls chatting and brings in a few emails, notice board messages, few other friends (enemies and frenemies). Entertaining and a quick read. Oh, I learnt a few new acronyms or should I say textronyms?

BFFAE, DEK, ICB, IDC, IDK, IHNC, SWAK, and WIGO
(I will answer in the end in case you want to take the _test_).

There are two other new genres from recent years.

1. LitRPG. This is where the main character / protagonist is suddenly in a game and that is their life. They start at level 1. They don't yet know the rules of the game, what the dangers are and neither the skills / power they have nor their weaknesses. They power-up, get allies and level-up. I believe Aleron Kong is said to be one of the main folks in this genre. My first read in this genre was "The Land: Founding" Chaos Seeds : Book 1 by Aleron Kong. [Savit and I used to listen to this in audiobook form during our school commute]. Got up to 4 books before we called it off.

2. Epistolary. The whole book is a series of letters. Of course, it is easy to make one from famous people. But these two books are stories conveyed through letters. I guess a natural progression from Epistolary is to emails and text.

The two books I read and can heartily recommend are:

i. Evidence of the Affair by Taylor Jenkins Reed. Almost reads like a thriller where the two non-guilty spouses catch their counterpart guilt-spouses' affair.

ii. Dear Committee Members by Julie Schumacher. What a hilarious book. I was laughing (should I say ROTFLMAO) at this story of an untenured Professor in a college writing to the Dean, fellow teachers, to students, writing recommendation letters and so on.
