I, Claudius
===========

No, that's not an Apple/iDevice related product. It's a novel by Robert Graves written (in 1934) as though it is an autobiography of the Roman emperor Claudius Caesar. It was made into a TV series by BBC (in 1976) and was written by Jack Pullman. It proved to be very successful and won many awards and is considered one of the best shows made. I had wanted to read the book first but never got around to it. So watched the TV series over the holidays. 

The story starts with Augustus Caesar well into his reign. But let me give a bit of intro starting with Julius Caesar. If you haven't watched the HBO series Rome, I highly recommend it. It's extremely well-done in my opinion and beautifully intertwines fiction with history. That was the starting point which got me very interested to learn more about the Greek and Roman history. Here is a brief list of main characters and some bio - hopefully this will get you interested too. As they say, truth is stranger than ficiton.

Julius Caesar
-------------

He was a Roman general who rose in ranks to become the head after winning many wars. Some tidbits : His first wife died, he divorced his second wife, he married his daughter to one of his friends (Pompey) - all part of the political game. He didn't have any children (legitimately to call a heir) and hence named his grand-nephew Gaius Octavius (Octavian) as his successor. He had a relationship with Cleopatra (although they never married) - ok, there is an interesting detour here (just a minute). The Julian Calendar was due to him and the month of July is named after him as well. He was murdered by Roman Senators, the most well-known one being Brutus (and how we got the phrase "Et tu, Brute?". But that seems mostly because Shakespeare said so. :) ).

*Lived from 100 BC to 44 BC. Ruled from 49 BC to 44 BC.*

Cleopatra 
---------

She was the queen of Egypt. She ruled along with her brothers Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV, who she also married. Yeah, you read that right. And then when Julius Caesar helped her overthrow Ptolemy XIV, she had a relatioship with Caesar. And then later had one with Mark Antony. Eventually committed suicide when Octavian overpowered Mark Antony and her. Also worth pointing out that Mark Antony and Caesar were very good friends and Mark Antony was second in command and helped Caesar win battles. But Octavian was way more clever and played his politcal game well.

Augustus Octavius (Octavian) Caesar 
-----------------------------------

He is consisdered to be the first Roman emperor. The name 'Caesar' is a title. So was Augustus. But he made it part of his name. He also deified Julius Caesar. So he became "Son of God". He had three wives (two died) and his third wife was Livia (who is an interesting character. Probably can equate her to "Sakuni" in Mahabharatha and "Mantara" in Ramayana, combined). More on her in a bit. He had one daughter (Julia) and all his sons were adopted. The last stepson (son of Livia) Tiberius Caesar would succeed him. He is said to have died of natural causes but there is always the suggestion that he was either poisoned or strangled, either way, killed by his wife and/or son. The month of August is named after him.

Octavian's first wife Clodia was Fulvia's daughter and Mark Antony's step-daughter. But after Fulvia died, Octavian gave his sister Octavia in marriage to Mark Antony to cement relationships. But of course, he later fought with him as well. Rome (HBO) shows all this (from Julius Caesar to Octavian ascending the throne) in great detail. I, Claudius, pretty much starts at a point where Octavius is well-established and is considering a successor. He also adopted two of his daughter's sons (from their second marriage) - but they also die at young ages. Her first-husband also dies young of food-poisoning. So does the elder brother of Tiberius (another son of Livia). And I, Claudius pretty much attributes all these deaths to Livia. He married his daughter Julia to his friend and war general Agrippa. After Agrippa died, he married her to Tiberius.

*Lived from 63 BC to 14 AD. Ruled from 27 BC to 14 AD.*

Tiberius Caesar
---------------

He is not only stepson but also a son-in-law of Augustus (since he was ordered by Augustus to marry his daughter Julia. If you are keeping track, Julia is his stepsister). He divorced his first wife to marry Julia (so as to strengthen his case to be the next emperor). Thanks to his mother Livia, he is the one left around (after 4 or 5 more before him all drop dead) to succeed. Tiberius' own son dies. His adopted son Germanicus dies too. There is a short detour of a general Sejanus who wants to marry Livilla but ends up being betrothed to her daughter. Livilla is the sister of Claudius. Livilla was also the wife of Augustus' grandson (who was to become the emperor after Augustus) but he died (surprise surprise!). She was eventually killed too.

He becomes very senile and of course, indulges in hedonistic activities. He didn't have any son to succeed him as well. His two choices were his grandson and Caligula (his grand-nephew and adopted-grand-son). He is also said to be killed by Caligula.

*Lived from 42 BC to 37 AD. Ruled from 14 AD to 37 AD.*

Caligula Caesar
---------------

One of the notorious kings ever. There is an infamous movie called "Caligula". Everyone ends up saying, "Oh, you should never watch that movie". Which only kindles the curiosity even more and you end up watching and realize how bad and perverted it is and end up giving the same advice to your friends and they repeat. <sad>. To give you an idea, imagine a very sadistic cruel perverted king and dial that up to 11. Now, watch the movie and I won't be wrong if you now have a new standard and what you thought was 11 is now a 5 or 6. :) I still warn you, don't watch that out. [but I know you will!]. A big part of his family (mother, brothers, sisters) were killed by Tiberius but he somehow escapes all that and doesn't show his anger towards the king. He killed a lot of people too (anyone in the family who he hated or suspected to be planning against him). He spared his uncle Claudius only because he (Claudius) was considered to be a dumb-wit and a laughing stock. Eventually he is killed by some Roman guards/senators too (just like Julius Caesar).

*Lived from 12 AD to 41 AD. Ruled from 37 AD to 41 AD.*

Claudius Caesar
---------------

He had a limp and a stammer and his family ostracized him. But it is also this that saves him from being killed as a conspirator. It's too hard to keep track of the relationships at this point. I give up. 

But thanks to wikipedia, here goes: "His maternal grandparents were Mark Antony and Octavia Minor, Augustus' sister, and he was therefore the great-great grandnephew of Gaius Julius Caesar. His paternal grandparents were Livia, Augustus' third wife, and Tiberius Claudius Nero.".

He married four times. His final marriage was to his niece, Agrippina. Her son from previous marriage was Nero. He would become the next emperor since Claudius did not have any sons. Claudius too is suspected to be killed (food poisoning).

*Lived from 10 BC to 54 AD. Ruled from 41 AD to 54 AD.*

Nero Caesar
-----------

He is also considered a tyrant. We also have the story of how he fiddled when Rome burned. He too killed members of his family. He committed suicide when he faced assassination. At this point, it is such a bigger clusterfuck that I cannot keep track of his ancestory but suffice to say he is also related to Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, Augustus, Tiberius and Livia, Agrippa, and a whole bunch of others. He had two wives and then eventually fell in love with a boy, who he castrated and then married him. Yup, very twisted. After Nero, there were four emperors in a short period (year or so).

*Lived from 37 AD to 68 AD. Ruled from 54 AD to 68 AD.*

So there, the story of Caesars. I bet this will give any daytime soap a run for its money and plot!
