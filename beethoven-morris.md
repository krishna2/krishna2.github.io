# Beethoven by Edmund Morris

Recently read a biography of Ludwig Van Beethoven by Edmund Morris. I picked this biography more out of convenience/availability but the life of Beethoven is very very interesting. A few things that I learned/liked.

Sometimes one gets compared to someone else. Especially when young. Either on basis of academic performance, arts or sports (or a wicked combination of all of the above). Well, Beethoven had one of the toughest comparisions of all time. The prodigy, the original boy-wonder, the "baby genius", the one and only Mozart himself! Beethoven's father made him give a performance when he was six. It was good but no one used the "M" word in their comparisions. Funnily enough, Beethoven was closer to 8. But since Mozart had set a threshold of 6 for performance, lots of kids, due to their parents' records, were all 6 when they gave their first performances.

Beethoven got an opportunity to meet Mozart, play for him and even learn from him. But had to return from Vienna within two short weeks since his mother was very ill. Mozart is said to have remarked to people in the next room, "Keep an eye on him. One day the world will speak of him". True dat!

He did return back to Vienna later and learned from Haydn (considered the father of the modern symphony). He lived there for the rest of his life.

Beethoven was the first (successful) freelance musician. He composed for his own self-expression. Very remarkable to read about Beethoven the entrepreneur and risk-taker.

One violinst complained that his piece was very tough and that piece should probably not be played on the violin at all and Beethoven angrily screamed back, "I cannot be bothered about your wretched instrument when the spirits seize me"!

I was surprised to read about all the conflicts he had and trouble he went through to get custody of his nephew from his own mother.

Of course, Beethoven story is not complete without his deafness. His hearing condition got worse and worse even at his mid-point in life and he soon became clinically deaf. He became depressed, bipolar and considered suicide but in the end said, "I will seize fate by its throat". He believed he had so much of music left in him and he want to get it all out. Oh my god, thank you! Thank you for the Ninth Symphony.

Thus we get to one of his crowning jewels - The Ninth Symphony. Rather I should say, one of the crowning jewels of all music. This was anticipated for many many years. Beethoven wrote the entire piece while he was completely deaf. By this time, everyone knew he was deaf. So they had another person to be the conductor but Beethoven also stood by the conductor's podium and did his own conducting. At times he would raise his hand to his full height, move his hands vigorously and sometimes scoop low to the ground. He was pretty much following the music score by looking at the violinists' hands and when the pages turned. The conductor had seriously warned the entire orchestra to not pay attention to Beethoven and only to him. This was also the first time, a choral section was included in a symphony and what a wonderful way it was done! Schiller's Ode to Joy was chosen for the Fourth Movement. The symphony at 75 minutes+ was thrice as long as the usual symphony. The audience loved it. Though a custom to wait till the end of the performances, during this premier, the crowd erupted with thundrous applause four times inbetween. Beethoven was just too engrossed in the musical scores and did not know (nor could hear) what was happening behind him. Until one lead singer finally took Beethoven by the arm and turned him around to see the applause his work was receiving.

He soon got sick and is said to have died on a stormy night. One friend who stayed nearby notes that Beethoven raised his right hand fisted and then dropped and then passed away. That's checking out in style. If anyone could do it or rather should do it, that would be Beethoven.
