# Notes on Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita (The Blessed Lord's Song) is deep philosophical text that packs it all in a mere 700 verses. It can be considered spiritual and even religious, if one wants to interpret it as such. It is a moral guide. It is a book that keeps on giving - the more one reads, the more the layers of meaning and its depth  and its appeal. Here are my notes on various topics related to this magnificient book.
