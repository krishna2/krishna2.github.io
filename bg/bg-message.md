What is the message of the Bhagavad Gita?

There are some scholars who have come up with the crux of the entire Gita in as simple terms as possible.

To go over their meanings, it is better to get some context of the first and last shlokas of the Bhagavad Gita.

| धर्मक्षेत्रे  | in the place of pilgrimage |
| कुरुक्षेत्रे  | in the place named Kuruksetra |
| समवेताः  | assembled |
| युयुत्सवः  | desiring to fight |
| मामकाः  | my party (sons) |
| पाण्डवाः  | the sons of Pandu |
| च      | and |
| एव   | certainly |
| किं   | what |
| अकुर्वत | did they do | 
| सञ्जय  | O Sanjaya. |
