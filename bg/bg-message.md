title: Bhagavad Gita's Message

What is the message of the Bhagavad Gita?

There are eminent scholars who have come up with a way to express the crux of the entire Gita in as simple terms as possible.

To go over their meanings, it is better to get some context of the first and last shlokas of the Bhagavad Gita.

The first shloka goes thus:

```
धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः ।
मामकाः पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत सञ्जय ॥

dharmakShetre kurukShetre samavetA yuyutsavaH .
mAmakAH pANDavAshchaiva kimakurvata sa~njaya
```

The last shloka is:

```
यत्र योगेश्वरः कृष्णो यत्र पार्थो धनुर्धरः ।
तत्र श्रीर्विजयो भूतिर्ध्रुवा नीतिर्मतिर्मम ॥

yatra yogeshvaraH kR^iShNo yatra pArtho dhanurdharaH .
tatra shrIrvijayo bhUtirdhruvA nItirmatirmama
```


Now let's look at the meaning of each word in the two shlokas.

 
|	धर्मक्षेत्रे	|	dharmakShetre	|	in the place of pilgrimage	|
|	कुरुक्षेत्रे	|	kurukShetre	|	in the place named Kuruksetra	|
|	समवेताः	|	samavetAH	|	assembled	|
|	युयुत्सवः	|	yuyutsavaH	|	desiring to fight	|
|	मामकाः	|	mAmakAH	|	my party (sons)	|
|	पाण्डवाः	|	pANDavAH	|	the sons of Pandu	|
|	च	|	cha	|	and	|
|	एव	|	eva	|	certainly	|
|	किं	|	kiM	|	what	|
|	अकुर्वत	|	akurvata	|	did they do	|
|	सञ्जय	|	sa~njaya	|	O Sanjaya.	|
|		|		|		|
|	यत्र	|	yatra	|	where	|
|	योगेश्वरः	|	yogeshvaraH	|	the master of mysticism	|
|	कृष्णः	|	kR^iShNaH	|	Lord KRiShNa	|
|	यत्र	|	yatra	|	where	|
|	पार्थः	|	pArthaH	|	the son of Pritha	|
|	धनुर्धरः	|	dhanurdharaH	|	the carrier of the bow and arrow	|
|	तत्र	|	tatra	|	there	|
|	श्रीः	|	shrIH	|	opulence	|
|	विजयः	|	vijayaH	|	victory	|
|	भूतिः	|	bhUtiH	|	exceptional power	|
|	ध्रुवा	|	dhruvA	|	certain	|
|	नीतिः	|	nItiH	|	morality	|
|	मतिर्मम	|	matirmama	|	my opinion.	|
 

## In One Word

If you take the first syllable of the first shloka and the last syllable of the last shloka (the 700th verse), the word formed is : धर्म (dharma).

So Bhagavad Gita is about **Dharma**.

## In Two Words

If you take the first word of the first shloka and the last word of the last shloka (the 700th verse), the word formed is : धर्म (dharma) मम (mama).

So Bhagavad Gita is about **My Dharma**.

## In Four Words

If you take the first two words, "धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे" (dharmakShetre kurukShetre), you can form a short four word phrase: क्षेत्रे क्षेत्रे धर्म कुरु (kShetre kShetre dharma kuru).

In all the "Kshetrams" do your dharma. A simple translation of "Kshetra" is "temple". 

But if you analyze carefully, there is an entire chapter in the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 13 entitled : "Kṣhetra Kṣhetrajña Vibhāga Yoga". 

Here Lord Krishna defines Kshetra as the body, the mind, and everything.

In this context, it again refers back to **whatever you identify yourself as, do dharma**.

I think the message is very clear. 

```
Dharma. 

My Dharma. 

Whatever you identify yourself as, do Dharma.
```

Happy reading the Bhagavad Gita!
