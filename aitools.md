# AI Tools

This is meant to be a quick introduction to getting started with the latest AI tools. If you are interested in learning more about the (not so) recent DeepSeek saga and AI links you 
probably should check out [https://krishna2.com/deep](https://krishna2.com/deep).

Obviously it is not easy to cover all the AI tools nor even cater to any one particular audience. So this is best suited for those who are looking to create something (generally software, 
web pages, presentations, content or anything creative). This is also meant for those who get a few starting points and then can figure the way from there. My intention is to give you a
lot of keywords and a few links (and people) to follow and if you keep at it, I am sure the algorithms will do their thing and you will have more than enough content to keep you
entertained and informed.

## LLMs

There are four big LLMs that you might already be aware of. Have subscriptions with at least 2 of them:

- OpenAI / ChatGPT
- Anthropic / Claude
- Google / Gemini
- X/Twitter / Grok

### Local Models

You should also consider trying something such as LM Studio. These tools allow you to download and play with models completely locally.

### Open Weights

Some models you will come across there would include:

- Llama (from Meta)
- Qwen (from Alibaba)
- DeepSeek (from DeepSeek)
- Gemma (from Google)
- Mistral (from Mistral)

## Creating Apps without Coding

For those who prefer being able to create without writing any code at all, you are in luck:

- Replit
- Lovable
- Bolt
- FireStudio

## Creating Apps with Coding

If you are into coding, you should note the following:

- Cursor
- Windsurf

### Coding Agents for Advanced Uses

For the advanced users, you can keep an eye on:

- Cline
- Roo Code
- Codex
- Claude Code
- Augment Code

## Folks to Follow

There are so many of them but I will try to give a short cut - a simple prescreptive version.

Follow [Greg Isenberg on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@GregIsenberg) and follow [Greg Isenberg on X/Twitter](https://x.com/gregisenberg).

If you watch his top hits, you will pretty much see the trends in AI. You will see the top tools (almost all the ones mentioned above). You will also see his coverage of AI startups and founders.

And that's the thread you keep pulling. Once you like a particular tool, a host or a technique, next follow their channels and recommendations.

At some point, you will have enough contetxt to be able to google what you need.

## Coda

Hope all that is helpful. I think this is the best way to be general enough to help a wide-range of folks for a variety of use-cases.

Above all, be cognizant of the meta-superpower of AI LLMs. Email will not teach you how to be better at Email. Excel will not teach you how to be better at Excel (if you ignore Clippy).

But LLM can teach you how to be better at LLMs!

You are not sure of how to prompt? Ask them LLMs, "I am trying to chat with LLMs, what's the best way to prompt?".

You are not sure if you asked correctly? Ask them LLMs, "what else should I ask? how can I better frame this question? what am I missing?".

You are not sure if you got full correct answer? Ask them LLMs, take one LLMs answer and put it in another LLM and ask away, "Can you critique this piece? I think this can be improved".

You are not sure if LLMs is being impartial? Ask them LLMs to play against itself! You can take its own output and then start a new chat and paste it and ask it to argue against that.

You can roleplay with LLMs. You can give it a title, any title, be as specific as you want to be. You give it your best. It will give it its best.

You are not sure of the output? Ask them LLMs, "explain it to me like I am five.". Or ask it to split it into many small steps. 
Now ask it to explain step by step. Ask it to illustrate with a drawing. Ask it to give examples. And few more examples.

As cliche as it sounds, you are only limited by your imagination.  And you can ask the LLM to imagine for you too or motivate you too.
