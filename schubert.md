# Franz Schubert

Franz Schubert is who you would call an obsessive compulsive composer. 

He died at an young age of 31. He started composing at the age of 15 and just in his last 16 years composed the following (that we know of):
- 9 Symphonies
- 10 Orchestral Overtures
- 22 Piano Sonatas
- 6 Masses
- 17 Operas
- 1000 Solo Piano Works
- 145 Choral Works
- 45 Chamber Works
- 637 Songs

We are left wondering what would Schubert have done if he had lived longer? [just like we wonder about Mozart (who too died young at 36)].

Happy birthday Schubert!
