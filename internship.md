# Internship

Here is a way to think about internships especially for students who are about to finish freshman year or even sophomore year.

I am about to try to convince a few of you that there are better things to do. So if you already made up your mind on internship, hit command-w.

I agree that
- internship is a safe route and a safe bet
- it could be at a good place leading to good experience
- which in turn could lead to job opportunities
- it is also a way to test out the company
- it is a way to test out a particular field / area
- you get paid and you get to experience a new city/state/country

But one could possibly get all these in a later year too. What is it that the earliest internship going to get?

Here are some reasons I think why the freshmen/sophomore might not have a productive internship. They would have barely completed the major degree's requirements in the first year or two. It is not just subject knowledge alone but a bit of managing project, learning to learn and other things. Hence companies / intern-host will tend to also give the simpler project

Large number of students are going to have an internship or two in their resume - so does three really matter?

Instead of 2 or 3 mediocre internships, I think it might be better to have one fantastic internship project.

The way to get such a project is to exhibit strong skills and knowledge.

The way to do that would be to invest the time and show drive and curiosity on one's own.

It need not just be about building technical skills alone.

I would venture to say the time is equally well spent if one travels and explores, reads mind-opening books, takes a casual course on a subject that is only of marginal interest (music, philosophy, language).

I think such a student is getting the rest they deserve. They are likely to be rejuvenated when they get back. They are likely to find a new interest. They can make stronger connections between fields or topics they thought was not possible or did not think existed.

There are many 'bicycles of the mind' skills in current day. Picking up any of these would be a strong multiplier for later years (even for later college courses as well as later internships). This compounds and it is extremely hard to come to terms with exponentials.

One way to find something interesting is to not think about or brainstorm ideas. But instead just to ask questions. Then find answers. This is likely to lead to more questions. It is probably not a good idea to ask questions that are too broad and too ambitious, e.g., "how can we achieve time travel?". It is better to ask a question that has an attack vector. One could ask "how can we cure cancer?". While important, it is better to ask a question which is within or close to one's circle of competence. 

Another way to think about your resume / your college / experiences is how you can tell a story.

The typical college student's resume is going to show "did well in high school", "got into good college", "did well in college", "did extra-curriculars 1, 2, 3" and "oh, here are two internships" and I have watched the entire Office series - ergo, I am qualified for real-world work opportunity.

Absolutely nothing wrong with that - just telling you that it is the typical template. It is average for a reason.

I assume you who are reading this is the one who is going for freshman/sophomore internship, right? So obviously you are driven and you want to achieve something more.

Well done and kudos for having the drive. I did not have that in my high school or college. Hence take all I am saying with a pinch of salt.

So given that you have a stellar background and looking to make it better, I think, I sincerely think you have a better shot at trying something on your own. 

Current ways of doing more with less, open source projects, models, networks enabling connections and collaborations make it possible to do things that were once unthinkable.

Don't play the short game. Don't play the safe game.

Nevertheless it is all anyways a game. Above all, learn from it and enjoy it!
