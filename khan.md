# Khan

Starting from a small tribe in the Steppes of Mongolia, in spite of being abandoned, bertrayed, captivated and deserted (didn't quite plan the abcd 
sequence of misfortunes, but this is but a fraction), Genghis Khan and his Mongol army would go on to achieve more in 25 years than the Romans did
in 400 years.

Coming up with a good title is half the writing battle (at least for me). Once I have a good title and question, the writing happens faster on its own. 
Clogging up my thoughts too long (blocking other stuff I want to write about) is the Mongol Emperor, Genghis Khan also called Jenghis Khan and some 
say it should be more correctly, Chingghis Khan. Call him any name, he is the one big Khan (Emperor) and the biggest of them all (if you want to 
tack superlatives  on top of superlatives).  Now why should you read about Genghis?

1. He changed the history of the world in more ways than we can imagine
2. Not just geographically and politically but also in warfare, religion, currency, business, communication .. so on.
3. It's a super entertaining story - now that we are a safe millenia away from it

If you want cheap thrill, read fiction. If you want serious thrill, read histories for Truth is far far stranger than fiction.

Remember the golden crown episode from Game of Thrones? Yup, that's what Genghis did in real life. A general would not pay his dues (Silver coins).
Genghis captured him, molted all his silver and poured it on his head. Or how about setting an entire castle on fire? Cutting off supplies to a castle
for months? Or .. you get the picture. Neither relishing the atrocities nor condoning them, those were but strange brutal times.

A super quick highlight reel of his life: Born Temujin to a small tribal leader, his father would be poisoned when following a custom of accepting a
meal offering during desert travel. His family deserted by all others , young Temujin would be left to fend for just immediate family.
When Uncles and friends would turn against to kill, he would have to escape many times. Eventually he would grow and attract a small following.
They would then go on to raid and form bigger alliances. Eventually he would ward off all his local Mongol enemies but the friction of having two big 
leaders (Temujin on one side and his best friend Jamaka on the other) would get too big to ignore. Temujin would go on to defeat his friend/army and call
up on a "Kurultai" (a big gathering of all mongol leaders who elect their new leader) where he would be anointed Genghis Khan.

The life in the Steppes is very nomadic, they would have a huge sheep and horse (smaller kind like ponies) as cattle and their life would be following
their grazing patterns and setting up Gers (huts / tents) and be on the move according to the seasons. They had very little possessions. They didn't have
any one place as home. Their diet is from the animals they grow and tend to. The Mongol kids would learn horseback riding from as early an age as 3 or 4.
They did not have any one strong religion. They would learn archery too from a young age. All of these seemingly small points here and there would add
up to be a much bigger sum than the parts that would uniquely contribute to the Mongol advantage in later years.
