# Sitare Spotlights - We are all Stars

Recently I got the wonderful opportunity to chat with Saumya. (TODO: add link to Blog and also to article page if any)
The talk started with a general introduction and moved on to focusing on one particular passion of mine, Reading.

But that being too wide a topic, we decided to focus on Philosophy and on that one book near and dear to my heart, The Bhagavad Gita.

We follwed the above main section with a wrap of topics about finding Infinity (for oneself) and our Utopia.

Of course, I cannot help but not be enthusiastic about books. 
All through my conversation I had mentioned various authors and books and this post is to capture it as notes.
Hopefully this is easy for anyone to follow and keep track (and bookmark/buy/read) the books they are interested in.

Here is the video for your viewing pleasure.
