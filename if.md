# On Intermittent Fasting

This is a short write up of what I learnt about Intermittent Fasting (IF).

1. What is IF? Can you give it to me quick?

If you can think of IF as CF (Intermittent Fasting (IF) as "Continuous Fasting"), that's that. What it does is flips the generally given advise
and the modern way of life on its head and says, "When you eat and how much interval you give between the food intake is as important if not
more important than what you eat".

2. How do you do it?

One popular way is called 16-8. You fast for 16 hours in a day (or a 24 hour period) and restrict all your eating to a contiguous 8 hour period.

*contiguous / continuous 8 hour is the key part here. Otherwise, very likely eveyrone is doing a 21-3 fasting every day - 
if you count only the minutes that you are actively eating.

3. Define fasting please?

Super simple: Fasting means you are consuming "ZERO calories". It doesn't involve looking at an item, the constituents of 
carbs, fats, proteins or whether it has milk or wheat or meat or fruit or vegetables or not. It is as simple as it can get.

4. Why does it work?  

Well, for one, you are not eating! Or you are eating less. (No shit Sherlock!). But let's say you manage to still consume the same 2000 calories 
within the 8 hour period, IF still works because of the prolonged period you give the body to be in the "burning mode" 
as opposed to the "fat storing mode".

5. Okay this is interesting enough that I want to learn more and rather from qualified people, can you give me pointers?

I am glad you asked. In fact, I would anyone who reads this drops this at this point and reads throught the following wonderful
life-changing illuminating books.

If you want to read only one book: 
[The Obesity Code by Dr. Jason Fung](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Jason-Fung-ebook/dp/B01C6D0LCK/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=obesity+code&qid=1598133378&sr=8-2&tag=k2bg-20)

But you should definitely consider also reading: 
[Why We Get Fat by Gary Taubes](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Fat-About-ebook/dp/B003WUYOQ6/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=why+we+get+fat&qid=1598133455&sr=8-1&tag=k2bg-20)

While you are at it, in fact, even more importantly than the above, first watch this:
Sugar the Bitter Truth by Dr. Robert Lustig: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM

Dr. Jason Fung has couple of other books (Diabetes Code and Guide to Fasting). Gary Taubes has written a bigger volume (Good Calories, Bad Calories).

There are lots of videos of Dr. Jason Fung on youtube that you might find illumniating.
