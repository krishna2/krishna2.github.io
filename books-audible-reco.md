# Recommendation of a few Audible Books and Great Courses

I choose these books as a starting point for a deep dive into a rabbit hole of immense pleasure of learning and enjoying.

### Music

This is one of the greatest professors/musicians in my opinion. Prof. Robert Greenberg. I have listened to over two dozen of his courses and can't get enough.

How to Listen to and Understand Great Music, 3rd Edition 

By: Prof. Robert Greenberg


### Philosophy

This is a wonderful compilation of great philosophers and their big ideas. An amazing intro.

The Great Ideas of Philosophy, 2nd Edition 

By: Prof. Daniel N. Robinson

### Origin and Evolution

Covers all the way from big bang to our tiny blue dot. Just mind-blowing.

The Origin and Evolution of Earth : From the Big Bang to the Future of Human Existence 

By: Prof. Robert M. Hazen

I will also heartily recommend "Origins of Life" by Prof. Hazen.

### Books(meta)

To get a little meta, this is a nice compilation of some of the greatest books. 
Again this turned out to be a good intro to many books and then lets one choose their own rabbit holes.
